Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

`@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector` is a connector for the popular [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) library and Web3Auth Web SDKs. 

You can utilise this connector package alongside the Web3Auth Web SDKs to  initialize a [wagmi client](https://wagmi.sh/docs/client) that will seemlessly manage the interaction of your DApp with Web3Auth.

## üìñ Documentation

## üí≠ Choosing Between SDKs

For using Web3Auth in the web, you have two choices of SDKs to get started with.

[Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK `@web3auth/modal`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/): A simple and easy to use SDK that will give you a simple modular way of implementing Web3Auth directly within your application. You can use the pre-configured Web3Auth Modal UI and whitelabel it according to your needs.

[Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK `@web3auth/no-modal`](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/): The core module implemeting all the Web3Auth features you need and giving you the flexibilty of using your own UI with the Web3Auth SDK working in the client side.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Installation (Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal)

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/modal
npm install --save @web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector
```

### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### Instantiate Web3Auth and pass it to the Connector

Here is an example of a wagmi client using both the `Web3AuthConnector` and the default `InjectedConnector` respectively.

```js
import { Web3AuthConnector } from "@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector";
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/modal";
import { createConfig, WagmiConfig, configureChains } from "wagmi";
import { InjectedConnector } from "wagmi/connectors/injected";
import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";

// Configure chains & providers with the Alchemy provider.
// Popular providers are Alchemy (alchemy.com), Infura (infura.io), Quicknode (quicknode.com) etc.
const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains([mainnet, arbitrum, polygon], [publicProvider()]);

// Instantiating Web3Auth
const web3AuthInstance = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x" + chains[0].id.toString(16),
    rpcTarget: chains[0].rpcUrls.default, // This is the public RPC we have added, please pass on your own endpoint while creating an app
    displayName: chains[0].name,
    tickerName: chains[0].nativeCurrency?.name,
    ticker: chains[0].nativeCurrency?.symbol,
    blockExplorer: chains[0]?.blockExplorers.default?.url,
  },
  web3AuthNetwork: "cyan",
});

const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [
    new Web3AuthConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        web3AuthInstance,
      },
    }),
    new InjectedConnector({
      chains,
      options: {
        name: "Injected",
        shimDisconnect: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
  publicClient,
  webSocketPublicClient,
});
```
